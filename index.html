	<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>

    <p><b>2-4 players</b> take turns playing <b>loot cards</b> and using <b>items </b> to kill <b>monsters </b>in order to gain more items, loot, and sometimes <b>souls</b>. The first player to gain 4 souls is the winner. Cooperation, bartering, and betrayal are all strongly encouraged.</p>

    <img src="img/basiclayout.png" alt="Basic layout as described in Starting the Game">

    <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
    <p>Shuffle the <b>loot</b>,<b> monster</b>, and<b> treasure decks</b>. Put out 100&cent;.</p>

    <p>Place <b>2 monster cards</b> face up next to the monster deck. These are the current active monsters, and each occupies an active monster slot. Place any non-monster cards revealed during set up on the bottom of the monster deck.</p>

    <p>Place <b>2 treasure cards</b> face up next to the treasure deck. These are the current shop items.</p>

    <p>Shuffle the character deck and deal out one character card and their starting item to all players.</p>

    <p>All players start with their character card <b>deactivated </b>(turned sideways). Everyone starts with their starting item <b>recharged </b>(turned upright). If you aren&rsquo;t going first, you can activate your starting item before your first turn.</p>

    <p>All players start with 3 loot cards and 3&cent; from the supply of &cent;.</p>

    <p>Cain plays first. If Cain is not in play, then the saddest person plays first.</p>

    <h2>Player Turn</h2>
    <ol class="phases">

    	<li><h3>Starting Phase</h3>
    		<ol>
    			<li>Recharge all your active items and your character card.</li>
    			<li>Start of turn effects <b>trigger </b>(are put onto the stack), then players can respond. This is the first opportunity to play effects during a turn.</li>
    			<li>Loot 1. (Draw 1 from the loot deck.)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><h3>Action Phase</h3>
			<p class="indent"><b>During their Action Phase , the active player may do any or all of the following in any order:</b></p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Play 1 loot card. (This can be in response to any action.)</li>
    			<li>Purchase 1 shop item or the topmost card of the treasure deck for 10&cent;, then replace any shop item purchased with the top card of the treasure deck.</li>
    			<li>Attack an active monster or the topmost card of the monster deck.</li>
    			<li>Activate their character card to play an additional loot card. (Character card activation can be reserved for activation on other players&rsquo; turns in response to any action.)</li>
    		</ul>
    	</li>
    	<li><h3>Ending Phase</h3>
    		<ol class="ending">
    			<li>End of turn effects trigger, then players can respond. This is the last opportunity to play effects during a turn. (If an effect ends the current turn, the turn jumps to this step.)</li>
    			<li>Heal all players and monsters, then effects that last until end of turn wear off.</li>
    			<li>If you have more than 10 loot cards in hand, discard down to 10.</li>
    			<li>Pass the turn to the player to your left.</li>

    <h2>Cards</h2>
    <div>
    	<img src="img/lootback.png" alt="Loot Card Back" class="cardback">
	    <h3>Loot Cards</h3>
	    <p>Loot cards are drawn and kept in your hand. Playing them can instantly change the flow of the game in many interesting ways. There are three different kinds of loot cards:</p>

	    <p><b>Basic Loot - </b>Basic loot cards come in the form of coins, bombs, hearts, pills and the like, and are used to gain resources or aid in combat.</p>

	    <p><b>Tarot cards - </b>Tarot cards are more advanced loot cards that can drastically change the course of the game.</p>

	    <p><b>Trinkets - </b>These are rare loot cards. Once played, these act like treasure items and have passive effects. Place these cards face up on the table next to your item cards. They count as items when in play, and they stay in play until destroyed.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<img src="img/monsterback.png" alt="Monster Card Back" class="cardback">
	    <h3>Monster Cards</h3>
	    <p>The monster deck is the meat and potatoes of the game. It&rsquo;s filled with basic monsters, bosses, curses and other surprises.</p>

	    <p><b>Basic Monsters - </b>Monsters that are easier to kill and yield loot, coins and on rare occasions, treasures.</p>

	    <p><b>Bosses - </b>Difficult-to-kill monsters with bigger rewards that always yield souls when killed. When a boss is killed, it becomes a soul card and the active player gains it. This is how you keep track of souls.</p>

	    <p><b>Bonus Cards - </b>Uncommon cards that may reward or kill the active player.</p>

	    <p><b>Curses - </b>Rare purple cards that curse a player of the revealer&rsquo;s choosing. The cursed player places the curse to the left of their character card. If they die, they discard all curses afflicting them.</p>
	</div>


	<div>
		<img src="img/treasureback.png" alt="Treasure Card Back" class="cardback">
	    <h3>Treasure Cards</h3>
	    <p>Treasure cards are items that players can gain. Place treasure cards directly into play in front of the player, visible to everyone. They tend to have very strong effects that modify gameplay and interact with other players and monsters. When an effect says &#39;Gain Treasure,&#39; it is taken from the top of the treasure deck.</p>

	    <img src="img/activesymbol.png" alt="Activate Symbol" class="actionsymbol">
	    <p><b>Active Items - </b>These items can be <b>activated </b>(turned sideways to use) at any time during your turn or in response to any action. Once an item has been activated, it can&#39;t be activated again until it&rsquo;s recharged at the start of its owner&#39;s turn or by a recharge effect. Active items have a gold border and a turning arrow symbol.</p>

	    <img src="img/paysymbol.png" alt="Activate Symbol" class="actionsymbol">
	    <p><b>Paid Items - </b>These items can be used when you pay a specific cost. Like active items, you can use paid items in response to any action, but you can use them as many times as they are paid for. Paid items aren&#39;t turned sideways when you use them. Paid items have a gold border and $ symbol.</p>

	    <p><b>Passive Items - </b>These items give players special abilities that usually change the rules of the game or modify existing effects with triggered abilities. These abilities don&#39;t require activation. Passive items have silver borders.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="printspace"></div>
	<h2>Dice Rolls</h2>
	<p>When a player rolls a dice initially, the roll goes onto <b>the stack</b> (see <b>Stacking Effects</b>). There are many ways to modify the roll before it <b>resolves </b>(affects the game) and either triggers effects or deals damage. Apply modifiers in the following way:</p>

	<ol class="onedot">
		<li>Effects that force rerolls or modify the roll result can be played.</li>
    	<li>Apply +X/-X to dice roll(s) effects.</li>
    	<li>Sacred Heart, Dad&rsquo;s Lost Coin, and The Missing Page trigger here. (If any rerolls or roll replacements resolve during this step, whether from the above cards or played effects, go back to Step 1.)</li>
    	<li>The roll resolves. If this was an attacking roll, damage from the hit or miss is put onto the stack, then other cards in play with dice roll triggers trigger before damage resolves. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Rolls and a monster&#39;s dice number can&rsquo;t go above 6 or below 1. </p>

    <p>Your &#39;first roll&#39; for the turn or combat is until a roll resolves or <b>fizzles </b>(see <b>Fizzling</b>).</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <p>Players may attack once a turn during their action phase. A single attack may have many dice rolls involved.</p>

    <p><b>If a player decides to attack,</b> they must declare what they are attacking to all players. Players can attack either one of the active monsters, or the topmost card of the monster deck. Once a player declares the target of their attack, combat starts. Combat ends normally when either the player or monster dies.</p>

    <p><b>If a player attacks the topmost card of the monster deck,</b> they reveal the card to all players.</p>

    <p class="indent2">If it is a monster card, place it face up over one of the active monsters; the active player chooses where to put it. The topmost monster card in an active monster slot is always the active monster in that slot. Only active monster effects can trigger.</p>
    <p class="indent2">If it is a non-monster card, the active player reads it to all players and follows the directions on the card. This counts as that player&#39;s attack for the turn.</p>

    <p><b>When a player attacks a monster card, they roll a D6. </b></p>

    <p class="indent2">If the roll resolves to a number equal to or greater than the monster&rsquo;s dice number, the player deals damage equal to their attack to that monster. Use a dice to keep track of damage done to monsters during the turn.</p>
    <p class="indent2">If the roll resolves to a number less than the monster&rsquo;s dice number, they miss and take damage equal to the monster&rsquo;s attack.</p>
    <p>The attacking player continues rolling until either they or the monster is killed.</p>

    <div class="printspace"></div>

    <p><b>Whenever a monster is killed (not necessarily in combat):</b></p>
    <ol class="onedot">
		<li>If the monster has an on-death trigger, put it onto the stack.</li>
    	<li>The active player always gains rewards for its death, including the monster soul if it is a boss. <b class="emph">Always</b>!</li>
    	<li>3. If the monster didn&rsquo;t turn into a soul card for the active player, it is placed face up on top of the monster deck discard pile.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Whenever a monster slot is empty:</b></p>

    <p class="indent2">If an active monster slot is empty, the active player reveals the top card of the monster deck to place a monster card in it. If the revealed card is a non-monster card, the active player follows the directions on the card, repeating this process until a new monster card is put into the slot. This can happen outside of combat whenever a slot empties. Remember, the active player <span class="emph">always</span> gets all penalties and rewards from revealing monster deck cards.</p>

    <p>It is possible to kill monsters outside of combat with effects. These actions do not constitute an attack for the turn.</p>

    <p><h2>Death</h2></p>

    <p>When a player takes lethal damage or dies for any reason, that player suffers <b>&ldquo;The Death Penalty!&rdquo;</b> They must:</p>

    <ol class="onedot">
		<li>Resolve item effects that say &quot;before paying penalties...&quot;</li>
    	<li>Destroy a non-eternal item they control.</li>
    	<li>Discard a loot card and lose 1&cent;.</li>
    	<li>Deactivate their active items and character card.</li>
    	<li>End their turn if they are the active player. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can only die once per turn, and you will heal back to full at the next ending phase. Dying removes you from combat (see Leaving Combat under <b>Fizzling</b>).</p>

    <p>If the active player and a monster die at the same time, resolve the monster&rsquo;s death before the player&#39;s death so that rewards are still given.</p>

    <p>Empty active monster slots must be filled at the end of the turn. This could happen when the active player dies while trying to fill a slot. After all end-of-turn effects are done resolving, but before players and monsters are healed, the active player (usually currently dead) reveals and resolves any non-monster cards until all empty slots are full.</p>

    <p>Death goes onto the stack. Players can play effects <b>in response</b> (see <b>Stacking Effects</b>). Preventing or fizzling death sets your health to 1 if you were at 0.</p>

    <h2>Fizzling</h2>
    <p>Some effects cancel other effects. In addition, effects can sometimes be cancelled by the state of the game changing before they resolve. When the latter happens, the effect <b>fizzles</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Invalid Targets - </b>Players must declare targets when playing effects. In addition, some effects require a certain condition to resolve. When a target leaves play or becomes untargetable for any other reason, or when a condition is not met when an effect resolves, the effect fizzles.</p>

    <p><b>Leaving Combat - </b>If an attacking player is removed from combat for any reason, any combat roll or combat damage on the stack fizzles. This can be from the player or monster dying, an effect cancelling the attack/combat, or an effect ending the turn.</p>
    <div class="printspace"></div>

    <h2>Stacking Effects</h2>
    <p>Most events go onto the top of <b>the stack</b> (the place where effects wait to resolve). The following are all of the events that use the stack:</p>

    <ul class="bull">
        <li>Playing loot cards</li>
        <li>Activating items</li>
        <li>Using paid items</li>
        <li>Effects triggering</li>
        <li>Intending to buy or attack (This is the last opportunity to play effects that change shop items or active monsters. You are not committed to purchase or attack until you have declared a target.)</li>
        <li>Declaring a purchase or attack by announcing a specific target</li>
        <li>Rolling a dice (see <b>Dice Rolls</b> for the steps which use the stack)</li>
        <li>Damage</li>
        <li>Player death</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to these events, there are two opportunities every turn to play effects. These are during the starting and ending phases.</p>

    <h3>Resolving the Stack</h3>
    <p>When there are no more effects to add to the stack, the effects on the stack resolve one at a time in reverse order. The most recent effect resolves first, then the 2nd most recent, until all effects are resolved ending with the initial effect.</p>

    <h3>Responding to Effects</h3>
    <p>Players can play effects <b>in response</b> to whatever effect is currently on top of the stack (i.e. would resolve next). As mentioned earlier, some effects can be cancelled or &ldquo;fizzled&rdquo; due to its target being gone or its condition no longer being met, perhaps due to an effect that resolved first. Once the stack is empty, the active player can make another action or otherwise progress their turn.</p>

    <p>Conceptually, think of each effect as a physical card, and as effects are played, you are piling the cards on top of each other. To find out what happens next, you take the top card off of the stack of cards and do what it say until the pile is empty.</p>

    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>If multiple effects trigger at the exact same time, they are put onto the stack in the following order:</p>

    <ol class="onedot">
		<li>Monster effects (If there are multiple monster effects, the active player chooses the order.)</li>
    	<li>Other effects (In turn order, starting with the active player. If multiple effects are owned by the same player, that player chooses the order that they are put onto the stack. Players determine when their death goes on to the stack, just like any other effect.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>Example 1: Player 1 decides to attack an active Monster that needs a 4 or higher dice roll to deal damage. Player 1 rolls their dice to see if a hit lands, and they roll a 3. In response to this roll, Player 2 offers to raise the roll by 1 with their Book of Belial in exchange for 2&cent;. Player 1 agrees, pays them, and Player 2 activates the Book of Belial to raise the roll to a 4. Out of nowhere, Player 3 decides to activate their D6 in response, forcing Player 1 to reroll the dice! No one else has any response to this, so each effect now plays out in reverse. Player 3 rerolls the dice and rolls a 1; Player 2 adds +1 to that dice making it a 2, then the dice resolves. Seeing as they needed a 4+ in order to land that attack, Player 1 misses and the attack fails.</p>

    <p>Example 2: Player 1 activates their Book of Sin item and rolls a 3 to Loot 1. In response, Player 2 uses their Sleight of Hand item to look at the top 3 cards of the loot deck and put them back in any order. No other effects are played. Player 2 looks at the top 3 cards, rearranges them so a single penny card is placed on the top. Then Player 1&rsquo;s Loot 1 effect resolves, and they draw a single penny&hellip; :(</p>

    <div>
	    <h2>Souls</h2>
	    <p>When a player gains a soul, whether from a boss dying or an item/loot card, they gain the card as a <b>soul card</b>. It now counts towards the players total soul count. The first player to have 4 souls wins the game.</p>

    	<img src="img/soulsback.png" alt="Souls Card Back" class="cardback">

	    <p>Once players have a better understanding of the game&rsquo;s mechanics, you are encouraged to add the Bonus Souls to your games. These bonus cards are not added to any deck, but instead they lay face up next to the game in view of all the players.</p>

	    <p>The first player to have 25&cent; or more instantly gains the <b>Soul of Greed</b>. The first player to have 10 or more loot cards in their hand instantly gains the <b>Soul of Gluttony</b>. The first player to have 2 or more Guppy items in their possession instantly gains the <b>Soul of Guppy</b>.</p>

	    <p>These souls, once gained, act like any other soul card. While there are ways to get back other souls that have been discarded, the bonus souls can only be gained once per game. If these soul cards are ever discarded, they are placed face down next to the game.</p>
	</div>
    <h2>Bartering</h2>
    <p>Players are encouraged to trade for favors or nefarious acts. When bartering, a player can pay another player any amount of &cent; for practically any favor. Player&#39;s can&#39;t trade items or loot in this fashion. Both players must agree to the exchange of &cent;. Players can&#39;t give &cent; away for no reason. Bartering does not use the stack.</p>

    <p>Once paid, promises don&#39;t have to be kept. Be warned: if you go back on your promises, it will be hard for others to trust you.</p>

    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <p><b>Active Player - </b>The player whose turn it is.</p>

    <p><b>&cent; - </b>There are only 100&cent; available. When it runs out, players need to spend or lose &cent; to increase the supply.</p>

    <p><b>Counters - </b>Counters are markers you place on specific cards that ask for them. They can be represented by anything you&#39;d like (stone, dice, coin, booger). If a card with counters is stolen, the counters stay on it.</p>

    <p><b>Damage Prevention - </b>Damage prevention is used to cancel incoming damage to a target. If not used immediately, the prevention stays until the end of the turn.</p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p><b>Deactive - </b>Items turned sideways are considered deactivated, and can&#39;t be activated until recharged.</p>

    <p><b>Destroy - </b>When a card is destroyed, it is placed in the appropriate discard pile. Destroying a monster counts as killing it.</p>

    <p><b>Discard - </b>Send to the appropriate discard pile. After a loot card is played, it is discarded. Discarding monsters yields no rewards. When a shop item or active monster is discarded, replace them if their slot becomes empty.</p>

    <p><b>Expand - </b>Effects can expand the shop or the number of active monsters. Fill the new slots from the top of the correct deck.</p>

    <p><b>Loot X -</b> Draw X cards from the loot deck.</p>

    <p><b>Play - </b>Items owned by players and items in the shop are considered &#39;in play.&#39;</p>

    <p><b>Steal/swap - </b>Unless an effect says otherwise, the stealing/swapping player chooses what to steal/swap.</p>

		</div>
	    <h3>Character Cards</h3>
	    <p><b>The Lost - </b>The soul attached to The Lost cannot be discard, stolen, or lost in any way. </p>

	    <p><b>Eden - </b>Cards with &quot;destroy this&quot; don&#39;t function with Eden because they gain eternal. Glass Cannon, for example, is overpowered as an item for Eden, as it can be used and never destroyed.</p>

    </div>
    <div>

		   <img src="img/lootback.png" alt="Loot Card Back">
		</div>
	    <h3>Loot Cards</h3>
	    <p><b>Butter Bean! - </b>When you cancel a loot card on the stack, the loot card is discarded first, then Butter Bean. Butter Bean can cancel Lost Soul and trinkets while they are on the stack, because they are not items/soul cards (i.e., still loot cards) until they resolve.</p>

	    <p><b>Counterfeit Penny - </b>This doesn&#39;t trigger when stealing &cent;. The effect is not an additional instance of gaining &cent;. </p>

	    <p><b>O. The Fool - </b>You can play this with your death on the stack to live. The death effect fizzles, you still move to the ending phase, but you are left with your original hit points (or 1 if it was lethal damage that killed you).</p>

	    <p><b>VIII. Justice - </b>You gain loot and &cent; equal to the difference between what you have and the target has. Imagine that you have 2 cards and 3&cent;, and your opponent has 5 cards and 1&cent;. You play Justice and loot 3 cards (up to 5) but gain 0&cent; (you had more).</p>

	    <h3>Monster Cards</h3>
	    <p><b>Ambush - </b>You don&#39;t need to make the attacks right away.</p>

	    <p><b>Cursed and Holy monsters - </b>Effects on these monsters can trigger outside of combat. Most other monsters with dice roll triggers only trigger when you are attacking them.</p>

	    <p><b>Daddy Haunt - </b>The effect adds 1 to the total damage you take. It isn&#39;t an additional instance of damage.</p>

	    <p><b>Devil Deal - </b>For the third option, you can&#39;t use the item before taking 2 damage.</p>

	    <p><b>Dinga - </b>If you kill on a 6, roll once and double for the total &cent; gained.</p>

	    <p><b>Greed! - </b>The richest player is chosen when Greed! Resolves.</p>

	    <p><b>The Haunt - </b>The effect triggers for every 2 points of cumulative damage it takes in a turn. The damage does not have to be dealt in a single instance.</p>

	    <p><b>&quot;Healers&quot; (Boil , Chub , Mega Fatty, Holy Dinga) - </b>Players and monsters cannot heal above their current max health.</p>

	    <p><b>Ragman - </b>Ragman&#39;s effect can undo getting the soul, potentially keeping a player from winning. </p>

		   <img src="img/treasureback.png" alt="Treasure Card Back">
		</div>
	    <h3>Treasure Cards</h3>
	    <p><b>9 Volt - </b>You can use recharged items before the next turn. (When the stack is empty, you can still add effects before the active player progresses the turn.)</p>
	    <p><b>Blank Card - </b>Multiple activations of this do not further multiply an effect. If the effect doubled requires a roll, just roll once and double the effect. Can&#39;t duplicate trinkets or Lost Soul. In general, this doubles any countable quality of an effect. For specifics, see the Appendix.</p>

	    <p><b>Diplopia/Modeling Clay - </b>Copying Dead Cat sets the counters on these to 9 every time. Copying other cards with counters does not copy the counters. Counters stay on these after they stop copying a card. If you copy any other card that uses counters, the preexisting counters remain and can be used.</p>
